How to contribute properly to open source software
-Investigate the project, understand its workflow and style, identify the scope and nature of your work.
- Identify how the roject communicates:
   - Reviewing emails
   - Study archives
   - Join an internet relay chat (IRC) cjannel.
- Understand how contributions are submitted-
   - Mailing lists
   - Email
   - Revision control system
- Study previous history 

Take into account licenses and agreements.i.e. CLA Controbutor License Agreements.

TIPS FOR SUCCESFUL CONTRIBUTION!
* Identify the maintainers, their work and methods.
* Get early input and work in the open.
* Contribute incremental bits, not large code dumps.
* Leave your ego at the door: Don't be thin skinned.
* Do not discriminate or offend.
*Be patient, develop long-term relationships, be helpful.

A revision control system does not solve the problem of making sure what a diverse group of contributors is doing actually works together.
This can only be done by testing. Testing reuires the following consideratins:
- Can overlapping sets of changes be applied simultaneously, or do they conflict?
- Does the project compile when all changes are applied?
- Does it work on all possible targets?
- What does working mean?
- Are there non-trivial test suites that can exercise a representative workload enough to give confidence things are fine?

Three stages:
1. Continous integration.
2. Continous delivery.
3. Continuous deployment.

Continous Delivery
----> Develop -> Build -> Test -> Deploy -> Release ---->

Restrictive vs PErmissive Licensing
Two basic categories:
 - Restrictive licenses: Software remains open; strong limitations on any attempt to make propietary closed products; changes to the code available to future recipients; e.h. GPL
 - Permissive licenses: Do not require modifications and enhacements to be generally available; e.g. BSD and Apache license.
 
 A software patent gives exclusionary rights to material such as a computer program, library, interfaces or even tecqniques and algorithms.
 Software patents must be filed in for each nation (or trading block such European Union) in which coverage is desired.
 Exactly what a patent can or cannot cover varies from juridiction to juridiction.
 
 Open Invention Network (OIN)
 Founded in 2005. Created a patent pool where companies and other entities enter in a mutual non-aggression agreement within the Linux-based ecosystem.
