+++++++++ Kernel vs. Operating System and Tools +++++++++
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Linux is only the kernel of the operating system (OS). 
- The kernel is the central component that connects the hardware to the software, and manages the system's resources, such as memory, CPU time sharing among competing applications and services.
- It handles all the devices that are connected to the computer by including so-called device drivers, and makes the available for the operating system to use.

Operating System
- Include important system libraries:
    - Shared libraries or dynamic libraries.
    - They can be used simultaneously by more than one program.
    - The most important one is libc, which is used by virtually every application
- Important system services (daemons)
    - Started when the system runs to control and monitor activities on the system, e.g. networking, prinitng, disk maintenance, noticing when the
    equipment is plugged in, monitoring system load and performance, etc.
- Basic System Utilities:
    - Those which handle files.
    - Shell program (bash - Bourne Again SHell).
- Graphical User Interface (GUI):
    - Almost all desktop Linux Systems will be built using the X Wondow System (or X). It has been around since 1984.
    - Besides X, there will be:
        - Window-manager which controls the appearences and behaviour of windows.
        - Desktop manager, which controls the entire desktop; the most common choices in Linux are GNOME and KDE.
        
Linux was first announce on August 25, 1991 by Linus Torvalds, at the University of Helsinki.
    - GNU FP License
    - In 2000 Open Source Development Lab (OSDL) was created as an independent non-profit organization with a mission to promote and optimize Linux.
    - In 2007, it merged with the Free Standards Group to form the Linux Foundation.
    
Linux and UNIX
    - Linux is only the kernel.
    - UNIX was deloped about 1969 by Thompson, Canaday, and Ritchie. It grew up largely otside of the Intel's familt of CPUs, althoug it was 
      later ported to it.
    - By the fist appearance of Linux, UNIX were on many varieties, grouped in two major families: System V and BSD.
    - Linux began as a small OS only on the x86.
    
UNIX
    - SGI : IRIX
    - Sun : SunOS and Solaris
    - IBM : AIX
    - HP  : HPUX
    - Cray : UNICOS
    - DEC : Ultrix
    - SCO was not arising from a hardware company.
    
The FSF's (Free Software Foundation) GNU project developed freely-distributable versionof many basic utilities: tar, ls, grep, gcc compiler and libc.
Some of the most basic Linux components that are completely rooted in UNIX are:
    - Inode-based filesystem.
    - Multi-process scheduling.
    - Process creation and destruction.
    - Accesid hardware through device nodes.

Linux Standar Base (LSB)
The Linux Standar Base was created to lower costs of supporting the Linux platform. By reducing the differences between individual Linux distributions, the LSB greatlly reduces the costs involves with porting applications ro different distributions, as well as lower the costs and effort involved inafter-market support of those applications.

+++++++ Graphical Layers +++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Linux graphical interface is actually composed of a number of layers, each of whic having a choice of options. The three basic layers ae:
1. The X Window System -> i.e. X Windows, Wayland.
2. The Window Manager -> i.e. Mutter, kwin, etc.
3. The Desktop Manager -> i.e. Gnome, KDE, etc.

++++ Display Managers +++++

---- X Window System -----
The X Window System (called X, Xorg or X11) born least since 1984. It was designed to handle displaying the results of activities on remote computers and its roots and ints roots it is fundamentally a communication protocol. X's main function is to handle keyboard and pointer input, and hamdle showing the results on the screen in multiple windows.
    * Server is what runs on your local machine which handles the input and display.
    * Client is the application being displayed and is as likely to be anywhere on the network and worldwide iInternet as it is on the local machine.
Almost all Linux distributions use the version of X that is supplied by X.org.
    - The basic configuration file can be found at /etc/X11/xorg.conf:
        - Controls things like: color-depth, display resolution, scanning rates, what pointers are available, which video card to use, etc.
        - The xorg.conf usually is generated by the distribution installation program and it may be modified through graphical interfaces.
        - In most modern Linux distributions, this file actually disappeard, and X is auto-configured on system start.
 
---- Wayland -----
Wayland is a newer system and is expected to gradually supersede it and was adopted as the default display system in Fedora 25.

++++++ Window Managers +++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
By itself, the Window Systems has limited functions; it does not control the exact placement and appeaetance of windows in the graphical interface. This is the job of the window manager; some of its functions include:
    - Controlling the appearance of window.
    - Controlling pointer focus properties.
    - Handling multiple desktops.
    - Providing tabbed windows.
    - Controlling visual effects.

<< The line between window manager and desktop manager is not always well-defined >>

There are a number of window managers available for Linux, and desktop managers have default choices:
    - Mutter for GNOME 3.
    - kwin fro KDE.
    - Other ones in use include: metacity, fvwm, fluxboxm enlightenment, sawfish, and xfwm.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++++ Desktop Managers ++++++
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The desktop manager sits above X and the window manager; it is what the user is most likely to directly interact with.
The tasks of the desktop manager include:
    - Providing taskbars, menu bars, drop-down menus, and methods of configuring them.
    - Offering applications (e.g. clocks, performance monitors, volue controlsm etc.)
    - Enabling placing icons and program launchers on the desktop and/or taskbar.
    - Giving choices for themes, desktops backgrounds and wallpaper, screensavers, etc.
    - Providing methods for drag and drop functionality, etc.
    - Making it possible to save the desktop state from one session to another subsequent login.

The most common desktop managers in use for Linux are:
    - GNOME (heavily dependent on the gtk set of graphical libraries).
    - KDE (built upon the QT libraries).
    - Others exist including XFCE.
