# System Boot
Virtually all x86-based physical Linux systems outside the embedded sphere) today use **GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader)** to handle the early phases of system startup.
Other platforms may have other equivalents, such:
- ELILO used on IA64 (Itanium), and
- Das U-Boot used on many embedded configurations.

Some important features of GRUB are:
- Alternative operating systems can be chosen at boot time.
- Alternative kernels and/or initial ramdisks can be chosen at boot time for a given operating system.
- Boot parameters can be easily changed at boot time without having to edit configuration files in advance.

In GRUB 2 the basic configuration file is **/boot/grub/grub.cfg** or **/boot/grub2/grub.cfg**. This file os autogenerated whe you run update-grub or grub2-mkconfig (depending on distribution), based on files in the **/etc/grub.d** and **/etc/default/grub**; IT SHOULD NOT BE EDITED BY HAND.

On some purely EFI systems, this file might be found in a directory like **/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg**. The essential configuration file contains some global information, and then a stanza for each operating system or kernel configured.

## Boot

On x86 systems, boot begins with the BIOS identifying and initializing all system and attached peripheral devices. If permitted by BIOS settings, the system can then boot off a peripheral device such as a CD, DVD, floppy, or USB, or through network PXE; more likely it will boot off the configured hard disk.
The **MBR (Master Boot Record)** contains both the *partition table* and the *bootloader*, a short program that is responsible for loading the operating system, and thus has to have at least sufficient smarts to locate and load the kernel from disk.
This kernel can have anny name; usually on Linux systems it is called something like **vlinuz-4.18.0** which includes the kernel version number.
- The z in vlinuz indicates the kernel is compressed; it self-decompresses upon loading.
- In most circumstances, it is placed in the **/boo** directory which is often on its own partition.

### /boot directory

There might be multiple possible kernels to boot into, each of which has four files associated with it:
- **vmlinuz** is the compressed kernel.
- **initramfs** contains a complete initial root filesystem which is loaded as a ramdisk, as well as some essential kernel modules (generally, device drivers) and the programs needed to load them, that are required to load the real filesystem, at which point it is discarded.
- **config** contains all the details about how the kernel was compiled; it is not needed for system operation.
- **System.map** lists the complete kernel symbol table; it is used for debugging purposes.

> Depending on qhich Linux distribution is beig used, there will be variations. For examplem the *initiramfs* file may actually be called *initrd*.

## System Initialization

### init

**/sbin/init (usually just called **init**
